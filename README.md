# Decoder Ring
## Hi there and thanks for checking this project out!

This project was set up as a way to encode and decode messages in three different ways as part of a party for a friend that loves puzzles and escape rooms.

### Features Include:

+ A Caesar shift that encodes and decodes messages based on shifting the alphabet a set number of places.
+ A Polybius square that encodes and decodes messages based on a grid and numerical pairs.
+ A Substitution cypher that encodes and decodes messages based on a replacement alphabet.

### Technology used: 

JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
